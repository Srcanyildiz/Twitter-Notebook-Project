Data is now everywhere and it is almost identical to your fingerprint. Today, the concepts of technology and accessibility have surrounded us so much that it is unfortunately not so easy to get rid of our phone or laptop.

In my opinion, data science is the art of making a delicious meal. While cooking, you can diversify your ingredients or change the way you cook, in order to reach new tastes or to present the existing ones even better. While working with data, you can reach the result you want in many different ways and materials, as long as the result is delicious. Just like the pleasure and happiness of eating, at the end of the day, if the output of your work doesn't taste delicious to you or the people you present, you may feel like all the work you've done is garbage. Most of the issues we talked about are not tangible, visible or unfortunately do not include substances that are the outputs of a human production. As a matter of fact, you will find yourself in a continuous tour of persuasion. As you know, the most important point about “Data” is to ask the right question and to make the right order for possible answers.
